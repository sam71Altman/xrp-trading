TASK: FULL TRADING MODES DIAGNOSTIC REPORT (NO CODE CHANGES)

CRITICAL:
This task is READ-ONLY diagnostic.

❌ DO NOT modify any code
❌ DO NOT refactor
❌ DO NOT change logic
❌ DO NOT optimize
❌ DO NOT add features

Only analyze and report.

=====================================
GOAL
=====================================

Audit ALL trading modes and generate a full technical report.

Modes to inspect:

1) DEFAULT_SMART (الافتراضي الذكي)
2) FAST_SCALP_NORMAL (السكالب السريع العادي)
3) FAST_SCALP_DOWN (السكالب الهابط السريع)
4) BOUNCE_HUNTER (اصطياد الارتدادات)

=====================================
WHAT TO ANALYZE
=====================================

For EACH mode measure:

1) Entry latency
   time between signal detected → order executed

2) Exit latency
   time between TP/SL hit → order closed

3) Execution path
   does close happen instantly or wait for trading_cycle

4) TP/SL accuracy
   does trade close exactly at target or overshoot

5) State consistency
   UI == Engine == Diagnostics

6) Message consistency
   trades count == telegram messages count

7) Blocking behavior
   any backpressure / cooldown / blocked entry

8) Strategy purity
   does strategy call broker or engine directly (violation)

9) Central engine impact
   does centralized execution slow fast scalping modes

10) Cycle time
   how long one trading_cycle takes (ms)

=====================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED)
=====================================

Print clear report:

=== TRADING MODE DIAGNOSTIC REPORT ===

For each mode:

MODE: FAST_SCALP_DOWN

Entry latency: ___ ms
Exit latency: ___ ms
Cycle delay impact: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
TP precision: EXACT / DELAYED / MISSED
State mismatches: count
Duplicate messages: count
Blocking events: count
Risk level: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
Notes: explanation

Repeat for all modes.

=====================================
FINAL SECTION
=====================================

Provide comparison table:

Mode | Entry ms | Exit ms | Delay Risk | Scalping Safe?
--------------------------------------------------------

Then add:

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- which modes are safe
- which are slowed by central engine
- which need fast-path exits
- which are unaffected

=====================================
REMINDER
=====================================

READ ONLY.
DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES.
ONLY PRINT REPORT.
