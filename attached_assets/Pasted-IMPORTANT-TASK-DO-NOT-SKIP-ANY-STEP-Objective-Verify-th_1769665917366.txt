IMPORTANT TASK – DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP

Objective:
Verify that Smart Hold Logic (v3.7.5) is fully integrated, active, and reachable in runtime,
and enforce strict versioning rules for all future updates.

==============================
PART 1 – VERIFY HOLD LOGIC IS REALLY WORKING
==============================

You must PROVE (not assume) that Hold Logic is active in the live decision path.

Required actions:

1. Locate and confirm the following conditions exist AND are connected:
   - Market Regime classification (EASY_MARKET / HARD_MARKET)
   - Bounce Entry logic
   - hold_active state flag
   - Hold exit conditions function
   - EMA exit override when hold_active == True

2. Add a mandatory runtime probe log (if not already present):

   [HOLD PROBE]
   mode={market_mode}
   score={score}
   rsi={rsi}
   bounce={entry_is_bounce}
   hold_active={state.hold_active}

   This log MUST appear every signal loop in HARD_MARKET.

3. Confirm by log evidence that:
   - HOLD PROBE appears repeatedly
   - bounce=False when conditions are not met
   - hold_active switches to True ONLY when bounce=True
   - EMA exits are ignored ONLY when hold_active=True

4. If Hold Logic is unreachable or bypassed → FIX IT.
   Do NOT claim success without log proof.

==============================
PART 2 – VERSION NUMBER ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)
==============================

Strict rule from now on:

- Any logic change, behavior change, or condition change
  MUST increment the bot version.

Required implementation:

1. Define a single source of truth for version, e.g.:

   BOT_VERSION = "v3.7.6"

2. Ensure this version is:
   - Printed at boot
   - Used in Telegram UI header
   - Logged in startup logs

3. Add a version integrity check:
   - Scan for hardcoded old versions
   - Fail startup if mismatch is detected

4. After completing THIS task:
   - Increment version from v3.7.5 → v3.7.6
   - Update ALL references consistently

==============================
PART 3 – FINAL CONFIRMATION OUTPUT
==============================

When finished, respond ONLY with:

- Confirmation that Hold Logic is reachable and active
- Sample HOLD PROBE log line
- Confirmed new version number
- Short summary of what was verified (not what was intended)

No assumptions.
No generic “everything works”.
Only evidence-based confirmation.
